What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

  Pros (automatic): Git automatically figures out what to include in a merge even
  if two people have different commits as long as they modify different sections
  of the file.
  Cons (automatic): Git doesn't know how to resolve conflicts when two people make
  changes to the same section or lines in a file. A conflict occurs. And the two
  people will need to decide on how the commits should be merged.

  Committing often is a very important thing.
